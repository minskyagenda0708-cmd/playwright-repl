# Backlog

## High Priority

- [x] **Unified `verify` command** — Single `verify` command with sub-types: `verify title "Hello"`, `verify url "/about"`, `verify text "Welcome"`, `verify no-text "Gone"`, `verify element button "Submit"`, `verify no-element button "Submit"`, `verify value e5 "hello"`, `verify list e3 "a" "b"`. Uses `String.includes()` for title/url. Old `verify-*` commands kept as aliases. `query` dropped — `eval` covers the same use cases.
- [x] **History loads in wrong order** — Investigated: current `.reverse()` + `.push()` logic is actually correct (newest at index 0). Not a bug.
- [x] **Dark mode toggle** — Sun/moon SVG toggle in Toolbar, `useEffect` toggles `.theme-dark` class on `<html>`, persisted via `localStorage`.
- [x] **Extension spawn path bug** — `engine.ts:133` resolves `--load-extension` to `packages/extension` instead of `packages/extension/dist`. Chrome needs the folder containing `manifest.json`, which is in `dist/`. Fix: append `/dist` to the resolved path.
- [x] **Auto-inject `expect` in `run-code`** — Not feasible: Playwright's `browser_run_code` uses `vm.createContext()` with only `page` in scope; `require()` is not available in the sandbox.

## Medium Priority
- [x] **CLI `clear` command** — Add `clear` to the CLI REPL to clear terminal output, matching the extension behavior. ([#15](https://github.com/stevez/playwright-repl/issues/15))
- [x] **Chaining selectors with `>>`** — When args contain `>>`, use `page.locator(<chained>)` instead of ref-based lookup. ([#16](https://github.com/stevez/playwright-repl/issues/16))
- [x] **Upgrade editor to CodeMirror 6** — Replace plain `<textarea>` in `EditorPane.tsx` with CodeMirror 6 (~30KB gzipped). Gains: syntax highlighting, proper selections, undo/redo, search. Potential custom `.pw` syntax mode later.
- [x] **Toolbar icons** — Replace text buttons (Open, Save, Export) with SVG icons in `Toolbar.tsx`, similar to existing sun/moon toggle in `Icons.tsx`.
- [ ] **Editor context menu** — Right-click menu in the editor with: Run line, Copy, Export to TypeScript, Copy to clipboard.
- [ ] **Capture locator** — "Pick element" mode: user clicks on the page, extension captures a Playwright locator string (`getByRole(...)`, `getByText(...)`) via `chrome.scripting.executeScript` overlay, similar to recorder.
- [ ] **Extract shared `resolveArgs`** — The verify-command translation, text-locator resolution, and run-code auto-wrap logic is duplicated between `extension-server.ts` and `repl.ts`. Extract to a shared `core` utility.
- [ ] **Failed commands not recorded** — `packages/cli/src/repl.ts`: `session.record(line)` only runs after success; replay files miss failed commands
- [ ] **History write errors silently swallowed** — `packages/cli/src/repl.ts`: `catch {}` hides disk-full or permission errors
- [ ] **Playwright version too loose** — `packages/cli/package.json`: `>=1.59.0-alpha` accepts any future version; pin to `<1.60.0` or similar
- [x] **Publish CLI to npm** — Published `@playwright-repl/core@0.7.10` and `playwright-repl@0.7.10` to npm. Closes #37.

- [x] **Command timeout** — `executeCommand` in `server.ts` has no timeout; a stuck Playwright command (e.g. `goto` with "Frame was detached") hangs the fetch forever, blocking all subsequent commands and requiring a full browser restart. Add a 30s `AbortController` timeout so the fetch aborts and returns an error instead.
- [ ] **Client-initiated reattach** ([#39](https://github.com/stevez/playwright-repl/issues/39)) — After a "Frame was detached" error (e.g. `goto` to a site with aggressive redirects), the Playwright backend loses its page reference and subsequent commands fail. Add a `/reattach` endpoint to the server that re-selects the current page via `browser_tabs`, and a "Reconnect" button or automatic retry in the extension panel to call it.
- [ ] **Fix skipped autocomplete keyboard test** — `test/components/CommandInput.browser.test.tsx`: "should accept autocomplete item on Enter when dropdown is open" is skipped. After `waitForVisible`, subsequent `userEvent.keyboard` events don't reach CM6's autocomplete handler (CDP focus vs JS focus mismatch). Needs investigation into vitest-browser keyboard dispatch and CM6 completion state.
- [ ] **Improve test coverage after playwright-crx migration** — Coverage dropped significantly after migrating from HTTP server to playwright-crx: `commands.ts` and `page-scripts.ts` are at 0%, `App.tsx` at 0%, `Toolbar.tsx` at 0% in unit tests. Add: (1) unit tests for `commands.ts` and `page-scripts.ts`; (2) component test for `App.tsx` (auto-attach on mount, tab switch listener); (3) E2E tests for attach status indicator (shows connected after panel loads) and port-based recording JSONL → editor pipeline. Also recover the 2 dropped E2E panel tests: "shows attached status" and "recorded commands appear in editor".

- [ ] **Fix failing recording component tab** — Recording via the record button fails to capture interactions on the component tab. Investigate why the recorder port/JSONL pipeline doesn't pick up actions on that tab and restore correct recording behaviour.
- [ ] **Auto-attach fails when only one tab open** — On fresh panel load with only one tab (e.g. `chrome://extensions`), the extension shows "Not attached". Adding a second regular tab (e.g. github.com) makes it work. Likely `getActiveTabId()` returns a chrome:// tab which is rejected, and there's no fallback to retry on next tab. Investigate and add a retry or clearer error.

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Recorder: merge fill + Enter into `fill --submit`** — When recording, absorb `press Enter` after a `fill` into a single `fill "loc" "value" --submit` command. The `--submit` flag already exists in the engine. Change is in `recorder.ts` `handleKeydown`.
- [x] **`highlight` command** — `highlight <locator>` as shortcut for `page.locator(<locator>).highlight()`. Useful for visualizing non-unique locator matches. ([#14](https://github.com/stevez/playwright-repl/issues/14))
- [ ] **Migrate monorepo to pnpm** — Replace npm workspaces with pnpm. Use `workspace:*` protocol for internal dependencies so version bumps no longer require updating dep versions in each package. Migration: `pnpm import`, delete `package-lock.json`, update CI/scripts to use `pnpm`.
- [ ] **Improve README structure** — Consider splitting README into per-package docs (`packages/cli/README.md`, `packages/extension/README.md`) with a concise root README linking to both.
- [x] **Convert to TypeScript** — All packages migrated to TypeScript.
- [x] **Extension server (Phase 8)** — `playwright-repl --extension` starts HTTP server; extension connects as thin CDP relay.
- [x] **Restructure the extension code structure** — Extension has `src/` folder with React components, Vite build step.
- [x] **Tailwind CSS migration** — Extension panel styles migrated from custom CSS to Tailwind v4 utility classes.
